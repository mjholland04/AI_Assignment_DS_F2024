### Reflection on AI assisstance

When completing this assignment, the use of AI really helped me when it came to specific implementations in code when I had ideas of what I wanted in my mind. It also helped me with effiency, being able to solve problems and write code faster than I would have. I think if someone would have been creating this notebook without proper knowledge of how Data Science worked, they would be in danger of misconstruing the data. Because of my time in this class, I understood that I needed a EDA and other things to examine my data before I accepted it and moved on to creating a model.

There were several instances when using the AI when it would attempt to do things relating to modeling or preprocessing my data and it would have problems or introduce bugs into my code. Because of my previous use of AI, I knew to proof-read code for logical correctness, I also was made aware of common bugs when my code would through errors because of mis-named variables or other reasons. These seperate things tipped me off when I needed to verify the outputs of Chat-GPT 4o.
